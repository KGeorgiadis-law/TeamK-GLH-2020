During the COVID pandemic, it has been more difficult for members of the public to exercise a right to free and anonymous attendance
at virtual hearings, as the calls are limited to named attendees. 

Open justice means:
+ The public should be free to attend court proceedings.
+ Proceedings are to be freely reportable.

Where individuals are able to gain access to virtual proceedings, or request a transcript, this is generally done with disclosure of 
that person's identity. This information may be of interest to other parties or government agencies.

Making virtual hearings accessible on a wide and anonymous basis online may raise questions concerning digital safety and protection
of personal information which are not a concern where there is limited in-person attendance at hearings.

If access to virtual hearings is denied to third parties, it is important that there is a clear process to apply for transcripts, and that
such transcripts are quickly and accurately prepared.
