The comparatively lower formality associated with video hearings may carry both advantages and disadvantages.

Individual litigants may find virtual hearings less intimidating and may find it easier to present a case with clarity and confidence. 
However, the implications and seriousness of court proceedings may equally be less obvious to individual participants in a virtual hearing. Approaching a hearing with appreciation of the meaning of the process is important, and it is also important that any Judge is able to convey sufficient gravitas to be able to manage proceedings effectively. Virtual hearings may lack a degree of formality which is derived, in part, from the physical design of court buildings and the presence of officials.
